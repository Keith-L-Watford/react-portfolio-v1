## Installation
No installs required to view the deployed app. However if you download locally, bring a movie and some popcorn so you have something to do while react installs with an npm i.

## Usage
Click <a href="https://keith-l-watford.github.io/react-portfolio-v1/" target="_blank">here</a> to see the deployed portfolio. 

## Notes
I sort of ran out of time with this iteration. I intended on using a new css framework and I decided on Material.io but I couldnt set up the nav bar in the way I wanted to. Luckily I did allot some time to switch course back to bulma incase I needed to default to a framework I was already very familiar with and import some styles/colors that I like.
